**Flash loan; NFT Fragmentation**

Airdrop contract checks if `msg.sender` own BAYC. Attacker could do this in one transaction by a contract:

1. "Borrow" a BAYC from NFTX
2. Claim the airdrop
3. return the BAYC to NFTX

Contract in this repo is a "loss-making trade". Because "Borrow" and "return"(mint) in NFTX need to pay fees. Borrow fee is 6% and mint fee is 10%.

We need to use flashloan to borrow some BAYC token first, but some of BAYC tokens are burned because of fee.

So we need to buy some BAYC token from SushiSwap to return the flashloan.

But liquidity of BAYC token in SuhsiSwap is so low that we have to pay about 50 ETH to complete the attack:

So a better way is to buy a BAYC from OpenSea first, then send it to NFTX to get some BAYC tokens to pay the fee. In this way, we can avoid losses due to small amounts of liquidity.
