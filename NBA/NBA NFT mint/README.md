Only addresses listed in whitelist were allowed to mint NBA's "The Association" NFTs through `mint_approved` function:

If the transaction data `info` satisfy the require expression, it will mint NFTs to `msg.sender`.

However, there are 2 factors which lead to that everyone can mint these NFTs:
1. The contract do not verify that if `msg.sender` and `sp.token_address` in signature data are the same.
2. No nonce in signature so one signature can be used multiple times.

So attacker can copy any success `mint_approved` transaction's data and use it to send a new transaction to get NFTs.
